#!/usr/bin/env bash
# asm-reindex-and-rsync.sh - scheduled job (run by multi-host-orchestrator, see
# mho_var.sh): reindex, then rsync the index with the remote host.
#
# Deployed alongside this script, under bin/: asm, asm-sync. Uses absolute
# paths rather than relying on $PATH, since schedulers invoke this with a
# minimal environment that usually doesn't include ~/.local/bin.
#
# No `set -e`: a failed reindex must never skip the rsync step below it - sync
# has its own independent success/failure handling (and logs to
# ~/opt/agent-session-manager/data/sync-log.jsonl), so it must always get a chance to run.
# The exit code still reports both: 0 only if both steps succeeded, so a failure
# shows on the multi-host-orchestrator dashboard instead of being hidden.
